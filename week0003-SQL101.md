[Week 0003 - "SQL 101"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W9oZdCgUIW5o6VJ4UBRIzKP_Z4-iERk-7GQAjiItpdE/) and accompanying [demo script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d8XO-lNyZ6q3RuQ72z9Xd-m67he9mZXW5-7kE3HY12o/)

Intro to SQL. What is the "sequel" thing I keep hearing about? Everything involves a database. What the heck is that? Let's take the first hour and dive into (S)tructured (Q)uery (L)anguage and learn the basics of talking to a relational database. We can certainly overflow into the subsequent hour with questions and assistance, but this week I'd like to begin formally ending the topic portion at the halfway point to allow open time each week to hack on whatever/pet projects/etc.
