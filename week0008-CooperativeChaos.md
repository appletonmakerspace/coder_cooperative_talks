##Week 0008 "Cooperative Chaos"

This week, let's give our editors (and search engines) a workout!

We'll tag-team the learning of several programming languages by each taking one or more languages that sound interesting to ourselves personally, and implement some portion of the below common language traits. At the end of the first hour (7pm-8pm) we'll stop coding and start sharing what we did.

To recap:

1. Pick a language
1. Setup your computer (or find a web site) to be able to use the language.
1. Implement one or more of the below traits.
1. Show us what you did!

Programming language traits

1. Produce output (echo, print, etc)
1. Accept user input
1. Use loops/iteration (for, while, until, etc)
1. Do a little math
1. Point out an object (if the lang supports objects)
1. Use code grouping mechanics (functions/methods)
1. Demonstrate primitive types (integer, string, boolean, float, character, etc)
1. Leverage data structures (array, list, hashmap, dictionary, stack, queue, etc)
1. Show use of a library (import/require/use/include)
1. Make a network call
1. Use a database
