##Week 0009 "Crash Course in Command Line"

This week let's do a command line primer.

As the original user input method (type commands, computer does stuff; pre-dating mice, monitors and even punchcards) a working knowledge of the command line is very useful.

Operating systems like Linux, Mac OSX and MS Windows have always provided a way to control the machine with your keyboard. Even mobile operating systems Android and iOS provide ways to directly manipulate devices by way of another computer.

We'll use this web site as a point of reference: [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

In addition we can cover ways to self-help and places to read for enlightenment.
