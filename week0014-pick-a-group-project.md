##Week 0014 "Pick a project"

Hi everyone!

This week let's brainstorm for group projects that we can work on!

Ideally the project would be able to incorporate contributions in many areas (design UI, backend, infrastructure, testing, security, usability, etc) and at any participant skill level.

I anticipate several viable group projects will be dreamt up. This will allow us to begin to alternate between "topic talk weeks" and "project weeks" as a group.

So what do you say? Add your ideas here on this handy poll and on Monday we can discuss and get started!
