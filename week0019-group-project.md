# Week 0019 "Group Project"
**2015-10-05**

I'll have the doors open and the hardware setup for the https://github.com/appletonmakerspace/info_display

If this project (produce/package web content for display on the kiosk) is not your cup of tea, no problem!  Bring your idea and we can work on that too!

Update: Got a Python example working to list upcoming events from the makerspace calendar. Should make good kiosk fodder.
