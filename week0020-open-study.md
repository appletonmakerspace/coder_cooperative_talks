# Week 0020 "Open Study"
**2015-10-12**

I haven't managed to derive a topic for this week.  However, I'll still be at the makerspace tonight 7pm-9pm in the computer lab learning *something*.

Come hang out tonight and dedicate a couple of hours to something that interests you in the realm of software.

Recent reading/tinkering I've done includes:
* [libsdl](https://www.libsdl.org/)
* [libuv](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/)
* [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
* C in general
* Python
* yaml

What have you been investigating?
