Most recently, I participated in the [hackathon on Saturday](http://dhmncivichacks.blogspot.com/2015/10/civic-hacking-meetup-this-saturday-oct.html).  This evening for my weekly dedicated Coder Cooperative time,  I think I'll continue working on the [Android app](https://github.com/dhmncivichacks/isitrecyclingweek) changes we began.

Come on out and hack on a project!
