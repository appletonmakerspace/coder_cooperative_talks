##Week 0022 "Testing - What, Why, How"

Inspired by new attendee Ben as well as conversations in the [NE Wisconsin Slack Channel](https://newslack.herokuapp.com/) let's talk about software testing.

* What is software testing? (unit test, integration tests, acceptance tests, etc)
* Why should I test?
* How can I test?

Let's share any testing experience we have or questions we want to ask.
