learning AngularJS.

If you are interested in starting to use AngularJS, this meeting should help you
develop an understanding of what fundamentals are necessary to get into AngularJS
with less roadblocks.

#### Already got mad ski11z?
If you are already deep into Angular, it would be awesome if you could come out
