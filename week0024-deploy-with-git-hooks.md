# Week 0024 "Deploy with Git Hooks"
**2015-11-09**

If you are already using Git to manage your source, it's not much of a leap to
use it for triggering the deployment of your project to your staging or production
servers.

## Topics

* What are Git hooks and how do they work
* Setting up hooks to trigger on various actions
* Creating simple bash scripts to take actions when a hook triggers

#### Not using Git?
Shame on you.  No, seriously, at least take the time to get a basic repo started
that you can use to back out changes when you break something. It's super easy.

#### Got a project you want to do this for?
Bring your own project to the talk tonight and we'll see if we can get you setup
with automated deployments using Git Hooks.
