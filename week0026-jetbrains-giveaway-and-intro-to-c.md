# Week 0026 "Pick the winner/Jetbrains license - Open topic"
**2015-11-23**

I'll conduct the license giveaway using the ["drawstraws" program](https://github.com/mikeputnam/drawstraws) and the names of the people who responded.

Other than that, I can go over the drawstraws program and give a mini-intro to c.

If none of the above interests you, then just come on out and code at our weekly meetup.
