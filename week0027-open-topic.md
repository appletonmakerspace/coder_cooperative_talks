# Week 0026 "Open topic"
**2015-11-30**

Another a la carte week with no predetermined topic.

Last week we had our youngest coder to date. Add one 10yro coder to the list of python fans!

I'll be working on a bit of Java/Android tonight. Possibly another venture into Intro Python if our young friend is in attendance again.

What would you like to work on tonight?
